Hello! I am Zhongmou He (‰ΩïÂø†Ë∞ã). You can call me Morris. Welcome to my personal website!üòä

I am currently a junior student in Data Science at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), fortunately advised by Prof. [Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/). Before transferring to UM, I spent two years at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I was advised by Prof. [Xinbing Wang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/%7Ewang-xb/).

I am interested in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning for graphs. My research focuses on utilizing LLMs for various downstream tasks. Please feel free to check out my CV!

# üìù Research Experences
**Leveraging LLMs for Link Prediction on Text-Attributed Graphs**

- **Advisor:** Prof. Danai Koutra
- Oct. 2023 - present;  University of Michigan
- Proposed a method that enables LLMs to efficiently understand the semantic, neighborhood, and pairwise structural information of nodes through multimodal instruction tuning. Designed an algorithm that leverages LLMs to rapidly filter out a large number of obvious negative target candidates, followed by quantitative evaluation of the remaining target candidates, which boosts the inference speed with minimal accuracy loss.
- Preliminary experiments indicated that the proposed model significantly outperformed the baselines across multiple datasets and demonstrated commendable cross-category and cross-task generalization capabilities. Moreover, the training and testing methods are both highly scalable.

**Development of the First LLM in Geoscience by Large-Scale Training**

- **Advisor:** Prof. Xinbing Wang
- Mar. 2022 - Sep. 2023; Shanghai Jiao Tong University
- Participated in the large-scale further training of LLaMA-7B, with data totaling 5.5B tokens. Collected 22M records from 6 data sources through techniques including PDF parsing and web crawling, and then restructured them into SFT data for 8 tasks, e.g., NER and text summarization. Performed efficient instruction tuning on the pretrained model using LoRA.
- Designed the first benchmark in geoscience. Led the evaluation of the model, exploring the impact of different evaluation methods, such as cloze prompts with various normalizations, on the model‚Äôs inference efficiency and accuracy.
